# PuTTY-Auto-login
Simple guide to make PuTTY login.

1) Make an shortcut of PuTTY, if you wish to use it for separate servers and what ever, just make your shortcut with a diff name.
2) Choose Properties and find "Target"
3) Add to target: *username*@*ip/serverhost* -pw *password*"  (*username*, *IP/Host*, *password*).

Should look something like this:
"C:\Program Files\PuTTY\putty.exe" root@testnet.ee -pw mypassword123
